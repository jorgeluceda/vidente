# Mean Reference

This application is to be utilized as a reference to build other Full-Stack MEAN Applications.

## Features

- **Heavily** commented code blocks so that the project can be easily leveraged.
- Multiple MongoDB Documents with nested sub-documents as examples.
- Optimized link routing in both the frontend application and the API.
- Decoupled API and frontend application to separate concerns.
- Form validation done in Application-Level with Node and Express, Application-Level with jQuery, as well as Server-Level with Mongoose using API.

## Branches

There will be three branches that you can utilize for your other projects, depending on your specific project needs:

- **server-rendered** branch: Express and Node.js Application
- **server-angular** branch: Express and Node.js Application with some Angular Components.
- **angular-spa** branch: Angular Simple-Page Application (SPA)

This repository is loosely based on the project available in the book "Getting Mean - with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node - Second Edition".
